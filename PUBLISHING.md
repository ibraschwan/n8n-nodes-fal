# Publishing n8n-nodes-fal to npm üì¶

Complete guide to publishing your Fal node to npm so it's accessible to everyone worldwide!

## Prerequisites

1. **npm Account**
   - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/signup
   - Create an account (free)
   - Verify your email address

2. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - npm requires 2FA for publishing
   - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/settings/YOUR_USERNAME/profile
   - Click "Enable 2FA"
   - Choose "Authorization and Publishing" (more secure)
   - Scan QR code with authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)

## Step 1: Login to npm

```bash
cd /Users/ibraschwan/n8n-nodes-fal

# Login to npm
npm login

# Enter your credentials:
# - Username
# - Password
# - Email
# - OTP (from your authenticator app)
```

Verify you're logged in:
```bash
npm whoami
```

## Step 2: Final Pre-Publishing Checks

### Check package name availability
```bash
npm view n8n-nodes-fal
```

If you see "npm ERR! 404 'n8n-nodes-fal' is not in this registry" - PERFECT! The name is available.

If it exists, you'll need to choose a different name (e.g., `@yourusername/n8n-nodes-fal`)

### Verify build is successful
```bash
npm run build
```

Should complete without errors.

### Test the package locally
```bash
# Create a test package
npm pack

# This creates: n8n-nodes-fal-1.0.0.tgz
# Extract and inspect if you want:
tar -xzf n8n-nodes-fal-1.0.0.tgz
ls -la package/

# Clean up test artifacts
rm n8n-nodes-fal-1.0.0.tgz
rm -rf package/
```

### Run lint
```bash
npm run lint
```

Should pass (warnings are okay, no errors).

## Step 3: Publish to npm! üöÄ

### First publish (version 1.0.0)

```bash
# Publish to npm
npm publish

# You'll be prompted for your 2FA code
# Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app
```

**Expected output:**
```
npm notice
npm notice üì¶  n8n-nodes-fal@1.0.0
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===
...
npm notice === Tarball Details ===
npm notice name:          n8n-nodes-fal
npm notice version:       1.0.0
npm notice filename:      n8n-nodes-fal-1.0.0.tgz
npm notice package size:  36.0 kB
npm notice unpacked size: 235.0 kB
npm notice total files:   197
npm notice
+ n8n-nodes-fal@1.0.0
```

### Verify publication

2. **Test installation:**
   ```bash
   # In a different directory
   mkdir test-install
   cd test-install
   npm install n8n-nodes-fal
   ```

## Step 4: Tag the Release on GitHub

```bash
cd /Users/ibraschwan/n8n-nodes-fal

# Create a git tag for the release
git tag v1.0.0

# Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Create a GitHub Release (Optional but Recommended)

1. Go to: https://github.com/ibraschwan/n8n-nodes-fal/releases

- Choose a scoped name: `@yourusername/n8n-nodes-fal`
- Update package.json name field
- Try publishing again

### "402 Payment Required"
- Your account may need email verification
- Check https://www.npmjs.com/settings/YOUR_USERNAME/profile

### "OTP required but not provided"
- Make sure 2FA is enabled
- Use `npm publish --otp=123456` (replace with your code)
- Or wait for the prompt and enter your code

### "Version already published"
- Bump the version number in package.json
- Run `npm publish` again

## Unpublishing (Emergency Only)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Unpublishing is permanent and can break dependents!

Only unpublish if absolutely necessary (security issue, wrong package published, etc.)

```bash
# Unpublish specific version (within 72 hours only)
npm unpublish n8n-nodes-fal@1.0.0

# Unpublish entire package (within 72 hours only)
npm unpublish n8n-nodes-fal --force
```

After 72 hours, you can only deprecate:
```bash
npm deprecate n8n-nodes-fal@1.0.0 "Please use version 1.0.1 instead"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always test before publishing**
   - Run `npm pack --dry-run` to preview
   - Test installation locally
   - Run all tests and lints

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md**
   - Document all changes
   - Follow semantic versioning
   - Users appreciate knowing what changed

3. **Follow semantic versioning**
   - Patch: Bug fixes (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
   - Minor: New features (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
   - Major: Breaking changes (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)

4. **Tag releases in git**
   - Makes it easy to roll back
   - Useful for tracking history
   - GitHub can auto-generate release notes

5. **Respond to issues**
   - Monitor GitHub issues
   - Help users with problems
   - Consider feature requests

6. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Run `npm outdated` regularly
   - Update dependencies carefully
